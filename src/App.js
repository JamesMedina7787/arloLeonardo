      <p> ` I started seven years ago. I did my first act at an open mic on macdougal
             street. The first time I performed was completely surreal. As the words
             traveled out through the audience, I felt as if I was disappearing into
             the crowd. That is when I became one with my art.<br/><br/>I did a month
             at first. A few years later, I returned. This time I kept steady at it,
             once a week, for about six months. It only took a half a year to return
             this time. Now I do it about three times a week. Even though I've left,
              I never could stay away. Comedy is hard, but life is harder. Every time
              life beat me up, it made me realize that the stage is more my place than
               anywhere else.`</p>
